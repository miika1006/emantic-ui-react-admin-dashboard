# Semantic UI React Admin Dashboard wireframe template

Very simple wireframe template to get started for admin dashboard. Created with create-react-app and then used Semantic library for UI. Check [Semantic UI React documentation](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and [github](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React).

Look at the source code and use in your project with
`copy & paste`.
